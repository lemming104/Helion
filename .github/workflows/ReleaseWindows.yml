# This workflow will build, publish, and release Helion.
# Release detail text is copied from RELEASENOTES.md.
# Release files will include source snapshots, and ZIP files with prebuilt executables for Linux and Windows (both single-file and runtime-dependent)

# Release checklist:
# 1.  Update RELEASENOTES.md
# 2.  Update version info in Directory.Build.props
# 3.  Ensure you are synced to a commit that includes the updated state of (1) and (2); run `git pull` if needed
# 4.  Create a new tag, e.g. `git tag 0.9.5.0`
# 5.  Push the new tag, e.g. `git push origin 0.9.5.0`
